In **BBBEasy** a `room` is designed around 3 principles:

`Room` : A web-conference or meeting room that has a name and a unique link.

`Preset` : A configuration preset that contains multiple configuration parameters, linked to the room policy itself and
to BigBlueButton.

`Label` : A room can be tagged by different labels to make it easily identifiable.
